        <h2>Hello there!</h2>
        <p>I am a Brazilian developer living in Germany. 
          <br>I have a special interest in user experience and clean designs. 
          <br>I usually focus on turning complex problems into simple, beautiful, and intuitive designs. 
          <br>When I am not coding, you will find me playing instruments, traveling, or spending time in the nature.</p>

          <h3>Musical Instruments</h3>
          <p>One of my passions is playing musical instruments, especially with other musicians. My main instruments are drums and guitar, but I also play bass and ukulele. In the future I intend to learn to play the piano.</p>

          <img class="interest-img2" src="images/icons/writing.png" alt="writing-icon">
          <h3>Writing</h3>
          <p>During my teenage years I developed the habit of writing down my thoughts. Writing became a hobby for me. I enjoy creating content and writing down my ideas. From these ideas came three book projects that I ended up publishing, which besides being fun, was a great personal achievement for me.</p>

          <h3>Board Games</h3>
          <p>The reason I love board games is much deeper than “because they’re fun.” I think they are capable of authentically building relationships and genuine community. It combines my love of strategy and logic with my love of family and friends. One day, I would like to create my own board game as a personal project.</p>

          <img class="interest-img4" src="images/icons/languages.png" alt="languages-icon">
          <h3>Language Learning</h3>
          <p>I not only enjoy learning new programming languages, but one of my greatest passions is learning foreign languages. This may not normally come to mind when one thinks of different types of hobbies, but it is certainly a hobby for me. Learning languages is not only enjoyable for me, but it also opens me up to a whole new world. The languages I currently speak are Portuguese, English, French, Spanish, German, and I am currently learning Italian. </p>

          <h3>Travelling</h3>
          <p>A hobby linked to my passion for languages is travelling. Traveling for me is not only about vacation and relaxation. Traveling helps me to grow as a human being, to know myself better and to better understand different cultures and people.</p>
